# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, created for practice and learning web development. I built this project with the help of a YouTube tutorial. The website is designed to showcase my work, skills, and personal information in a clean and modern layout. Tailwind CSS was used for styling, and JavaScript adds basic interactivity.

## Features
- Modern and clean UI design  
- Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop  
- Project showcase section  
- About section with personal introduction  
- Contact section (non-functional placeholder)  
- Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS CDN  

## Technologies Used
